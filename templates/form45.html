  <h2>THE COMPANIES ACT 1967 (SINGAPORE)</h2>
  <h1>FORM 45 – CONSENT TO ACT AS DIRECTOR AND STATEMENT OF NON-DISQUALIFICATION</h1>

  <p><strong>Name of Company:</strong>
    <%= company_name %>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Company No (UEN):</strong>
    <%= uen %>
  </p>

  <p>I, <strong>
      <%= name %>
    </strong>, of <%= address %>, declare that:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>I consent to act as a Director of the abovementioned company with effect from <u>
        <%= date %>
      </u>.</li>
    <li>I am not disqualified from acting as a director under Section 155 of the Companies Act 1967 and:

        <li>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
          industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
          scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
          electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
          Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
          PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                   The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
          1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original
          form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. RackhamI have not been convicted of any
          offence involving fraud or dishonesty punishable by imprisonment for three months or more in Singapore or any
          foreign jurisdiction within the past five years.</li>
